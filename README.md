This website is designed to evaluate the eligibility of students for admission to a university at different levels.

The website features an easy-to-use interface that allows students to enter information about their education, extra-curricular activities, and achievements. The website then calculates a score based on these criteria to determine if the student is eligible for admission. Furthermore, the score also helps to determine which subjects the student is eligible for.
